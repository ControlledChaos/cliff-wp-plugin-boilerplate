/**
 * All of the code for your admin-facing JavaScript belongs in this directory, split into as many JS files as you wish.
 *
 * Note: It has been assumed you will write jQuery code here, so the
 * `$` function reference has been prepared for usage within the scope of this function.
 *
 * This enables you to define handlers, for when the DOM is ready:
 *
 * $(function() {
 *
 * });
 *
 * When the window is loaded:
 *
 * $( window ).load(function() {
 *
 * });
 *
 * ...and/or other possibilities.
 *
 * Ideally, it is not considered best practice to attach more than a
 * single DOM-ready or window-load handler for a particular page.
 *
 * The file is enqueued from src/Admin/class-Assets.php.
